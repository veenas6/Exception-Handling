## 📘 Description

This program demonstrates the concept of **exception handling** in Java using a simple division operation.
It takes two integer inputs (numerator and denominator) from the user, performs the division, and gracefully handles any exceptions such as **division by zero**.

---

## 🧩 Features

* Demonstrates **try-catch-finally** blocks in Java
* Handles **ArithmeticException** for division by zero
* Uses the **Scanner** class for user input
* Ensures resources are properly closed with a **finally** block

## 🏁 Expected Output

**Example 1: Normal Input**

```
Enter numerator: 10
Enter denominator: 2
Result: 5
Program execution completed.
```

**Example 2: Division by Zero**

```
Enter numerator: 8
Enter denominator: 0
Error: Division by zero is not allowed!
Program execution completed.
```

## ⚙️ How to Run

1. Save the file as **DivisionExample.java**
2. Open a terminal or use an IDE such as Eclipse
3. Compile the program using:
   `javac DivisionExample.java`
4. Run the program using:
   `java DivisionExample`
5. Enter two integers when prompted
